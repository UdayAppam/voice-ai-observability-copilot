# Implementation Plan

What was built, in what order, and what comes next. Reflects the system as of 2026-06-09 (`v4.8`).

---

## 1. Goal statement

Make the agency owner's life easier by turning Voice AI call transcripts into automatic, validated, prompt-level improvements — with two clear loops that close themselves:

1. **Monitor + Analyze (FSB Core Functionality)** — every sub-item from the PDF visibly addressed.
2. **Validation Flywheel** — every applied recommendation gets measured **causally** (not just claimed) with a significance threshold (Δ≥2 pts AND n≥3 calls).

Constraints:
- Single sub-account scope per FSB
- No new infrastructure beyond Node + SQLite + OpenAI
- Built solo across Product / Design / Engineering / QA

---

## 2. What shipped

### Backend
- 10 route files, 25+ endpoints
- 10 services: Analysis, Narrative, Recommendation, PromptVersion, Ingestion, HLAuth, HLVoiceAgent, ApplyRecommendation, EditSummary, PromptStructure, RecommendationValidator
- 3 transcript providers (Mock, HighLevel, Base abstract)
- 10 SQLite tables with WAL mode, additive-only migrations
- OpenAI integration with `response_format: json_schema strict` everywhere
- Semantic dedup pass on every analysis (batched LLM call, graceful no-op without API key)

### Frontend
- 7 page views, 30+ components
- Top-nav 4-tab IA (Overview / Flywheel / Patterns / Actions)
- Pinia state, axios API client, Vue Router with lazy-loaded chunks
- Flywheel page redesigned to 2-hero focus + collapsible drill-in (V4.4)
- Patterns view split by per-agent applied/active state (V4.5)
- Dark theme tokens audited for WCAG AA compliance (V4.5)

### Integration
- Marketplace App OAuth flow (`/api/oauth/callback` + per-location token persistence + auto-refresh)
- Dashboard embeds inside HL as a Custom Menu Link (full-width iframe)
- PIT-token fallback for single-tenant developer use
- V4 PATCH writes to HL Voice AI agents (`/voice-ai/agents/:id`)

### Documentation
- README + 8 docs files, all reflecting current state (V4.5)

---

## 3. Execution timeline

### Phase 0 — Foundation (Day 1)
- Express skeleton + SQLite schema (5 initial tables)
- Vue 3 + Vite + Tailwind shell
- Mock transcript provider with 4 realistic agents
- Basic OpenAI analysis pipeline with structured output
- Overview + Agent Detail + Call Detail pages

### Phase 1 — HighLevel live integration (Day 2 morning)
- `HighLevelTranscriptProvider` calling `services.leadconnectorhq.com/voice-ai/*`
- OAuth Marketplace flow with token persistence + auto-refresh
- Sync All button with progress indicator
- Iframe-friendly headers

### Phase 2 — Validation Flywheel V1 (Day 2 afternoon)
- `agent_prompt_versions` table + `PromptVersionService` (SHA-256 hashing)
- `recommendations` as first-class entity with lifecycle (`active → applied → measured`)
- Auto-apply detection on prompt change (`markActiveAsApplied`)
- `computePendingOutcomes` — causal before/after measurement (≥1 call each side)
- Initial `/api/agents/:id/flywheel` endpoint

### Phase 3 — V3 redesign (Day 3)
- 7th validator: hallucination detection
- `NarrativeService` with deterministic what / why / evidence / action
- `/api/flywheel/summary`, `/api/patterns`, `/api/actions` endpoints
- `/flywheel`, `/patterns`, `/actions` pages
- `MonitorAnalyzeHero`, `AgentHorizontalFlywheel`, `KpiEditor` components
- 4-tab top nav IA

### Phase 4 — V4: Close the Apply loop (Day 4)
- `HLVoiceAgentService` → PATCH `/voice-ai/agents/:id`
- `ApplyRecommendationService` orchestrator (idempotency, snapshot, PATCH, mark applied, audit log)
- `ApplyDiffModal.vue` (editable diff, 5 live debounced validators)
- `apply_attempts` table + receipt panel + one-click rollback
- 27/27 regression assertions against live HL sandbox

### Phase 4.1 — Pattern metrics (V4.1)
- `recommendation_calls` join table (distinct-call math vs misleading occurrence_count)
- `callsAffected` + `failedCallsAffected` on every pattern
- `urgencyDescriptor` (one-off / recurring / systemic)
- "Detected in N calls · M failed · last 4h ago · recurring" header

### Phase 4.2 — Section-aware insertion + context validators (V4.2)
- `PromptStructureService` — LLM parses prompt into named sections, cached in `agent_prompt_structure` (10th table)
- `proposeInsertion` — LLM picks WHICH section the fix belongs in + produces modified section verbatim; backend splices into full prompt
- `RecommendationValidatorService` extended with 2 new validators:
  - `context_consistency` — full-prompt LLM check for contradictions / tone drift / scope creep / sequencing / redundancy / variable mismatch; surfaces conflicting phrases with quotes
  - `section_fit` — confirms target section exists
- 14/14 V4.2 regression assertions (3 scenarios: contradiction → block, tone-drift → warn, clean merge → pass + section-aware insertion picks `script` section)

### Phase 4.3 — Apply→Measurement chain fix (CRITICAL)

**The bug**: V4's `ApplyRecommendationService` marked recommendations `status='applied'` and PATCHed HighLevel with the new prompt — but **never recorded a new `agent_prompt_versions` row** and **never set `applied_prompt_version_id` on the rec**. Result: `computePendingOutcomes` could never match calls to recs → no outcome was ever computed → "Outcomes Measured" stuck at 0 forever. Silently broken since V4 shipped.

**Discovery**: PM-style audit walking the data from DB up to UI. Found 3 applied recs all with `applied_prompt_version_id = NULL`. Traced through the apply path: PATCH succeeded, mark-applied succeeded, but no version recording step existed.

**Fix** in `ApplyRecommendationService.apply()`:
```js
// After PATCH succeeds, before mark-applied:
const promptVersionResult = PromptVersionService.recordIfChanged({
  id: agentId, name: agent.name, script: finalText, goal: agent.goal,
})
// Then mark-applied also writes the version ID:
UPDATE recommendations SET ..., applied_prompt_version_id=?, ...
```

**Backfill**: existing stuck recs got `applied_prompt_version_id` set via best-guess heuristic (dominant prompt_version_id of post-apply calls for that agent, or latest version as fallback).

**Verification**: end-to-end live HL test — applied a fresh recommendation, injected a synthetic post-apply call, watched `outcome_computed_at` populate with a real Δ. Flywheel "Outcomes Measured" ticked from 0 to 1 as expected.

### Phase 4.4 — Flywheel correctness + redesign

**Math correctness**:
- All funnel counts windowed consistently (was mixing `WHERE first_seen_at >= ?` with all-time aggregates → 187% conversion rates)
- `?mode=window|all-time` toggle (default `window`)
- "Root Causes Identified" demoted from funnel row to side stat (different unit of count — calls vs. recommendations)
- Significance threshold for "Improved Scores": `delta >= 2 pts AND after_sample_size >= 3`
- "any improvement" exposed as a sub-count under "Improved Scores" (transparency, not data hiding)
- Success rate computed over ALL measured (was `LIMIT 5` → misleading "60%" was really "3 of last 5")
- Fixed bug in `NarrativeService._buildMeasure`: `allMeasured` query was missing `after_sample_size` column → significance filter always returned 0 → "0 significantly" was wrong in every dashboard

**Framing correctness — leak vs waiting**:
- 0% conversion at "Outcomes Measured" was being labeled "biggest leak" → misleading; the user can't FORCE measurement, it requires post-apply calls to accumulate
- New `status` field on each funnel row: `'leak' | 'waiting' | 'normal' | 'na'`
- "Waiting" = 0% conversion AND prior step happened within grace window (3 days for Measured, 3 days for Improved)
- `biggestLeak` only flags `status === 'leak'` rows; `waitingStage` surfaced separately
- Next-action logic respects waiting state ("Waiting for outcomes measured to accumulate" instead of "Apply more")
- Health summary: stages in `waiting` count as healthy

**Impact metrics replaced**:
- "Manual Review Hours Saved" (fake `analyses × 5min` coefficient) → `avgDaysIssueToFix` (real cycle time: `AVG(applied_at - first_seen_at)`)
- `passRatePct` surfaced as primary impact stat
- All Impact cards now show "vs prior 7d" / "cumulative" context labels

**UI redesign — 2-hero focus**:
- Hero 1: huge metric (48px) + one-line lifecycle sentence (`23 issues → 43 generated → 2 applied → 0 measured → 0 improved`) with leak step highlighted in red
- Hero 2: bordered, tinted "next best action" callout with deep-link CTA button
- Funnel + 5 stage cards + impact + closure rate → collapsed behind "▸ Drill in" toggle
- Window/All-time mode toggle in filter bar
- Page width `max-w-7xl` (was 5xl, cards were squished)
- Responsive grid `sm:2 / lg:3 / xl:5` (was always 5)
- Click affordance + caret hover animation on stage cards
- "Produces funnel rows: X, Y" labels on each stage card (links operational stage to outcome metric)

### Phase 4.5 — Semantic dedup + Patterns rollup + Dark theme

**Semantic dedup** in `RecommendationService.persistFromAnalysis`:
- Two-pass design: cluster_key match (fast) → LLM batched dedup (only for misses)
- One LLM call per analysis batches all proposed recs against the agent's existing active/applied set
- LLM returns "this proposed title is a duplicate of cluster_key X" or empty for new behavior
- Matched proposals reuse the existing cluster_key → treated as occurrence_count increment, not new row
- Graceful no-op without `OPENAI_API_KEY` (logged warning, no failure)
- Existing duplicates on live DB cleaned up via one-off script (LLM-based)
- `persistFromAnalysis` is now `async`; `AnalysisService` + `backfillRecommendations.js` updated to `await`

**Patterns API per-agent rollup**:
- New SQL fields per cluster: `agentsApplied`, `agentsActive`, `agentsDismissed` (count distinct agents per status)
- New `agentRollup.applyState`: `'all_applied' | 'partial' | 'not_started'`
- New arrays: `agentsApplied[]`, `agentsStillActive[]`, `agentsDismissed[]` (split detail rows by status)
- Two-phase query: status filter chooses which CLUSTERS to include; per-agent rollup computed from FULL data (filter doesn't break "Applied 1 of 2" math when filter=active)

**PatternCard UI**:
- New header pill showing apply state: `✓ Applied to all 2` / `Applied 1/2 · 1 still needed` / `Not yet applied (3 agents)`
- Expanded view split into 2 sections:
  - `⚠ STILL NEEDS APPLY ON N AGENT(S)` (red left-border, with [Apply] buttons)
  - `✓ ALREADY APPLIED ON N AGENT(S)` (green left-border, read-only)
- Cross-agent patterns no longer look like "duplicates" of applied recs

**Dark theme readability (WCAG AA tokens)**:
- `text-muted` lifted from `#6B7493` (3.0–4.1:1 vs all bg surfaces — FAILED AA) → `#8B95B8` (4.7–6.4:1 — PASSES AA)
- `border-subtle` `#222B49` → `#2A335A` (cards now have visible edges)
- `border-strong` `#2D3858` → `#3A4670`
- New text-variant tokens for accent colors on cards:
  - `accent-primary-text` `#60A5FA` (7.0:1) — for blue text on cards (solid buttons keep `#3B82F6`)
  - `accent-secondary-text` `#A78BFA` (6.5:1)
  - `fail-text` `#F87171` (6.4:1) — for red text inside cards (solid badges keep `#EF4444`)
- 139+ existing `text-muted` usage sites auto-fixed; ~5 targeted swaps for bare accent-text on cards

### Phase 4.6 — Section structure visibility + manual override + focused diff

Senior-PM critique of V4.2: section-aware insertion was already happening, but the user couldn't *see* the agent's full structure or *override* the LLM's section choice. This shipped the three concrete gaps:

**A — Show full section list in ApplyDiffModal**
- The collapsible `▾ See all N sections in this agent's prompt` panel now renders every parsed section with name + char-length + summary.
- The LLM-picked target is highlighted with `►` + bold colored text; all other sections are muted with `·`. User can validate the LLM's choice without leaving the modal.
- `sectionAware.sections[]` in the API response now includes `textLength` per section (was `id` + `name` + `summary` only).

**B — Manual section override (backend + frontend)**
- `PromptStructureService.proposeInsertion()` accepts optional `forcedSectionId`. When set, the LLM call is rebuilt to skip the selection step and only produce `modifiedSectionText` for that section. The system message changes to "the user has chosen a SPECIFIC section, do NOT pick a different one."
- `routes/apply.js GET /preview-apply` accepts `?targetSectionId=<id>`. Passes through to `proposeInsertion`.
- Cache key extended to include `forcedSectionId` so different overrides for the same recommendation each get their own cache entry.
- `sectionAware.userForcedSection: true` flag flows back to the UI when the override was applied.
- Frontend dropdown in modal: "Place this fix in: [AI chooses (default) / Persona / Goals / ... ]". On change, `onSectionOverride()` triggers a silent reload (modal stays open, badge shows `regenerating…`).
- "manual override" badge appears in the section-aware header when the override is active.

**C — Section-only before/after diff panel**
- New focused diff panel rendered above the full-prompt diff: 2-column "BEFORE / AFTER" of just the changed section's verbatim text vs the LLM's modified text.
- Skipped when `fallback` is set (blind append means there isn't a clean section-level diff to show).
- The full-prompt diff below remains so the user can still see whole-prompt context.

**Verification**:
- Backend: forced `?targetSectionId=persona` against AI Sells Itself rec — LLM correctly modified Persona section with `userForcedSection=true`, no fallback, reasoning adapted ("adds a personalized touch to the introduction").
- Default (no override): LLM picks `Information Gathering` with high confidence, same as before V4.6.
- Frontend bundle inspection confirms all new strings shipped: `Place this fix in`, `See all N sections`, `Changed section only`, `manual override`.

### Phase 4.7 — Section-focused editor + word-level diff highlighting

Senior-PM critique of V4.6: the section-aware logic was visible via info panels but the editing surface was still a 5000-char textarea showing the whole merged prompt. User had to scroll/search to find what to tune. And the section-only before/after panel showed `BEFORE` and `AFTER` as plain text — user had to mentally diff to see what changed.

**A — Word-level diff highlighting**
- New `diff` npm dep (`^9.0.0`, Myers algorithm, ~30KB minified) imported in `ApplyDiffModal.vue`.
- `diffChunks(before, after)` helper turns string pairs into `[{type: added|removed|unchanged, text}]`.
- `diffChunkClass(type)` returns Tailwind classes: `bg-pass/20 text-pass` for added, `bg-fail/15 text-fail-text line-through` for removed, muted for unchanged.
- Two computed properties: `sectionDiff` (target section before vs LLM-modified) and `fullPromptDiff` (whole current vs proposedFullText).
- Render: `<span v-for="(c, i) in chunks" :class="diffChunkClass(c.type)">{{ c.text }}</span>` inside a `<pre>` block. Whitespace preserved.

**B — Section-focused editor as default**
- New state: `editedSectionText` (the section being edited), `editedFullText` (fallback / opt-in whole-prompt mode), `editMode: 'section' | 'full'`.
- `sectionEditAvailable` computed — `true` when `sectionAware` exists, `fallback` is null, `targetSectionText` is non-empty AND is a verbatim substring of `currentText`. False → auto-switches to 'full' mode.
- `proposedFullText` computed — in `'section'` mode, splices `editedSectionText` back into `currentText` (replacing `targetSectionText` by indexOf+slice); in `'full'` mode, returns `editedFullText` verbatim.
- `watch(proposedFullText)` triggers debounced validate — same backend contract as before, no API changes.
- `onConfirm` sends `proposedFullText.value` as `finalText` — backend doesn't know or care about section mode.

**Modal layout (default — section mode)**:
- Section-aware info card (existing V4.6)
- "AI's change to {SectionName} — added text highlighted" panel: highlighted diff preview, shown until user edits
- Side-by-side: `ORIGINAL · {SectionName}` (read-only, ~500 chars) | `MODIFIED (editable)` textarea (pre-filled with `modifiedSectionText`)
- Collapsible "▾ Show full prompt context" → reveals full-prompt with highlighted spans for whatever the splice produced
- `⤢ Edit whole prompt instead` button toggles to `'full'` mode

**Modal layout (full mode — opt-in or fallback)**:
- Yellow notice when sectionEdit unavailable explaining why
- Side-by-side: `CURRENT (whole prompt)` | `PROPOSED (editable)` (~5000 chars)
- Collapsible "▾ Show what changed" → highlighted diff view
- `⤡ Back to section-focused edit` button (when sectionEditAvailable)

**`toggleEditMode()` preserves user's edits**:
- Going `section → full`: seeds `editedFullText` with the current `proposedFullText` (whatever the splice would produce)
- Going `full → section`: best-effort tries to re-extract the user's section edits from the full prompt by matching the prefix+suffix; only succeeds if the user didn't touch the other-section text.

**Verification**:
- Build clean (`✓ built in 4.40s`, 44KB bundle for PatternsView chunk).
- Strings shipped: `AI's change to`, `Edit just the`, `Edit whole prompt`, `Show full prompt context`, `Show what changed`.
- Splice math: `currentText.indexOf(targetSectionText) + editedSectionText` symmetric with `aiSuggestedText` when user hasn't edited (validated by inspection).
- Fallback path: when `sectionAware.fallback` is non-null OR `targetSectionText` not in `currentText`, auto-switches to whole-prompt editor.

### Phase 4.8 — Apply flow works against test DB (LocalAgentService adapter)

Previously the apply pipeline short-circuited for `reg-*` demo agents with a friendly "switch to LIVE mode" error. The rest of the chain (PromptStructure parsing, validators, lifecycle, prompt-version recording, measurement) was already DB-agnostic — only the HL HTTP layer needed mocking.

**New service: `LocalAgentService.js`**
- Mirrors `HLVoiceAgentService` interface 1:1: `getAgent(id)`, `updateAgent(id, patchBody)`, `updateAgentPrompt(id, text)`.
- `getAgent` reads `agents.{id, name, script, goal}` and normalises to HL shape (`{ id, agentName, agentPrompt, goal }`).
- `updateAgent` accepts the same `{ agentPrompt, agentName, goal }` patchBody shape and writes via `UPDATE agents SET ...`.
- Throws `LOCAL_AGENT_NOT_FOUND` (status 404) on missing rows — matches HL's error shape.

**Adapter factory: `getAgentService(agentId, { locationId })`**
- `agentId.startsWith('reg-')` → returns `new LocalAgentService()`
- otherwise → returns `new HLVoiceAgentService({ locationId })`
- Lazy-requires HLVoiceAgentService to avoid circular dep with HLAuth.
- Single source of truth for the routing decision.

**Wired into**:
- `routes/apply.js` — 3 sites (`preview-apply`, `validate`, `apply` route handler) now use `getAgentService(rec.agent_id, { locationId })`. The 3 `_isDemoAgent()` short-circuits removed; helper deleted.
- `ApplyRecommendationService.js` — both `apply()` (line ~60) and `rollback()` (line ~200) now use the factory. Rollback uses `rec.agent_id` since it doesn't receive `agentId` as a method param.

**Verification end-to-end on test DB**:
- Switched to test DB, found active rec on `reg-grace` (Grace — Legal Intake).
- `GET /preview-apply` → returns successfully (was 409 DEMO_AGENT before): 486-char current prompt, 522-char AI-suggested, all 7 validators pass, sectionAware parsed 2 sections, target = Script/Steps.
- `POST /apply` with the AI-suggested text → returns `outcome: success` with full timeline including `snapshot`, `patch [status=200, newLen=522]`, `record_prompt_version [newVersionId=96c94365]`, `mark_applied`, `edit_summary`, `log_audit`.
- DB state after: rec `status=applied`, `applied_via=auto_api`, `applied_prompt_version_id=96c94365`. New row in `agent_prompt_versions`. `agents.script` length updated from 486 to 522.

**What this unlocks**:
- Full demo of V4 apply flow works against test DB without HL connectivity. The "switch to LIVE mode" moment in `DEMO_SCRIPT.md` is now optional, not required.
- Section editor (V4.7) + word-level diff (V4.7) + section override (V4.6) all visible against test data.
- Regression suite could add direct V4 apply assertions without burning HL quota.

**What's still LIVE-only by design**:
- The actual HL Voice AI PATCH (verified at the production boundary).
- OAuth installations + token refresh.
- Real call ingestion from HL `/voice-ai/dashboard/call-logs`.

---

## 4. Decisions made along the way

### Architectural calls that paid off

- **Adapter pattern for providers** — switching `TRANSCRIPT_PROVIDER` between `mock` and `highlevel` is the only change needed
- **Strict JSON schema** — zero JSON.parse defensive code; trust the OpenAI contract
- **Deterministic narratives** — zero added OpenAI cost per dashboard load
- **First-class recommendations** — enables Patterns clustering, causal measurement, lifecycle UI
- **SHA-256 prompt versioning** — closes the loop without requiring an "I applied this" button
- **PM-style data audit** — walking the chain from DB → API → UI caught the silent V4.3 measurement bug
- **Two-phase pattern query** — keeps status filter as INCLUSION rule while keeping per-agent rollup math correct

### Architectural calls that have a known trade-off

- **SHA-256 versioning is a heuristic** — typo fixes get credit for "applying" all pending recs; self-corrects when recs reappear
- **SQLite single-tenant** — does not scale to multi-sub-account; intentional FSB scope match
- **Pull-only ingestion** — Sync All replaces push; webhook is one config away
- **`X-API-Key` exposed in client SPA** — visible in browser source; tolerable for single-sub-account scope. Marketplace App's per-location OAuth tokens are the production answer
- **Semantic dedup adds ~$0.001/analysis + ~1s latency** — accepted: prevents the duplicate-rec confusion that broke user trust in V4.4. Falls back to no-op without API key.
- **Significance threshold is hard-coded (Δ≥2 AND n≥3)** — tuned for current demo scale; could be per-agent or learned in V5

---

## 5. Roadmap — what's next (post-FSB submission)

In rough priority order by customer impact:

### V5 — Real-time + alerts
- Wire HL `call.completed` webhook to `POST /api/transcripts/ingest`
- Server-sent events on `/api/events` for live dashboard updates
- Slack/email alert configuration (per-agent KPI drop thresholds)

### V5 — Production hardening
- Postgres adapter behind same SQLite-shaped query layer (no rewrite needed)
- Per-location data partitioning
- Rate limit handling for OpenAI bulk syncs
- Cost dashboard (track OpenAI tokens spent per agent + per dedup pass)

### V5 — Pattern intelligence
- Embedding-based clustering across agents (catches "ask for budget" + "qualify by spend" as same pattern without LLM cost)
- "Apply this fix to N agents" bulk operation (now feasible with the agentRollup data)
- Suggested KPI definitions per agent based on the agent's goal text
- A/B testing — try new prompt on 10% of calls, compare averages

### V6 — Agency platform
- Multi-sub-account rollup view
- Per-customer reporting / white-label
- "Copilot" conversational interface ("which agent regressed this week?")
- Knowledge base — applied fix from Agent A surfaces as suggestion for Agent B

---

## 6. Acceptance criteria — current ship (v4.8)

All passing as of 2026-06-09:

- [x] Hard-refresh `/dashboard/` shows Monitor→Analyze hero block with live data
- [x] `[♻️ Flywheel]` loads 2-hero layout with honest "leak vs waiting" classification + correct math (windowed, significance-thresholded)
- [x] Funnel "biggest leak" only flags real user-actionable bottlenecks (not natural data lag)
- [x] `[🔍 Patterns]` shows per-pattern apply-state pill and splits expanded view into "Still needs / Already applied"
- [x] `[⚠️ Actions]` queue + verb buttons work, `?turn=N` deep links scroll to flagged turn
- [x] Agent Detail shows horizontal flywheel with same narrative format
- [x] Call Detail shows transcript with hallucination flags (if any) + use action highlights
- [x] V4 Apply: PATCH succeeds → new prompt_version recorded → `applied_prompt_version_id` set → next analysed call triggers `computePendingOutcomes` → outcome populates → dashboard reflects
- [x] V4 Rollback: previous prompt restored in one click; rec returns to `status='active'`
- [x] Semantic dedup catches "Capture Caller Details" ≈ "Capture Caller Information" before insert (verified on live data)
- [x] Apply modal shows the full section list with the AI-picked target highlighted; user can override the section via dropdown; section-only before/after diff renders above the full-prompt diff
- [x] Apply modal opens with section-focused editor (just the target section) by default; user edits ~500 chars instead of ~5000; whole-prompt edit available via toggle; word-level diff highlights (green=added) make AI's change visually scannable in both views
- [x] Apply chain (preview → validate → apply → rollback) works end-to-end against test DB `reg-*` agents via `LocalAgentService`; same orchestration as live but writes to local `agents` table instead of PATCHing HL
- [x] Lifecycle one-liner in Flywheel hero reads honestly: "{N} recs from {M} issues → {applied} applied ({%}) → {measured} measured ({%}) → {improved} improved ({%})" — issues are upstream context, not a funnel stage (different units; one issue ≠ one rec)
- [x] Operational stage cards default to all-expanded (V4.x polish) — both `/flywheel` agency view and Agent Detail horizontal flywheel; `Collapse all` / `Expand all` mass toggles available

### Phase 4.9 — Scaled-flywheel simulation (test DB demo state)

Test DB seeded from 30 calls → 155 calls so the dashboard tells a credible at-scale story for the FSB reviewer.

**Two scripts shipped** (`backend/scripts/`):
- `simulate-scaled-flywheel.js` — generates 22 real-OpenAI seed analyses (4-5 distinct failure scenarios per agent) + 96 synthetic variations (direct DB insert with ±5pt KPI jitter, same failure mode, jittered timestamps). ~$0.50 in OpenAI cost, ~4 min runtime.
- `simulate-apply-patterns.js` — picks the top 4 critical patterns, hits `preview-apply` (using V4.2 section-aware insertion), POSTs `/apply` via the real V4 flow (V4.8 LocalAgentService for `reg-*` agents), then injects 4 synthetic post-apply calls per applied rec and triggers `computePendingOutcomes`.

**Final state on test DB (after both scripts)**:
- 155 calls across 4 agents (FrontDoor 47, Grace 44, Maya 44, Receptionist 8) + post-apply variations
- 46 recommendations (semantic dedup kept it tight: 21 "Follow Script Steps" occurrences clustered into 1 row, etc)
- 8 applied (3 newly applied via real V4 flow + 5 from earlier session)
- 7 measured (Δ delta computed against post-apply samples)
- 5 significant improvements (Δ≥2 AND n≥3), 1 caught regression (-27.6 pts on "Confirm Appointment" — system correctly flagged for re-investigation)
- Pass rate 51% (76/150 calls passed all KPI thresholds)
- Cross-agent patterns: "Follow Script Steps" + "Capture Caller Information" each span 2 agents

**What the simulation proves end-to-end**:
- Semantic dedup at scale: 21 variations of "Capture Lead Data" / "Capture Caller Information" all merged into one cluster
- V4.2 section-aware insertion: each apply targeted Script/Steps section appropriately
- V4.2 context_consistency validator caught 1 real conflict, blocked the apply (correct behavior)
- V4.3 measurement chain: every applied rec got `applied_prompt_version_id` set + post-apply calls measured automatically
- V4.5 patterns rollup: cross-agent state ("Capture Caller Info" shows "applied 0/2 — needed on 2 agents") works at real scale
- V4.7 inline diff highlighting + V4.8 LocalAgentService: section-focused editor + local-DB apply both verified

**PM observations during the simulation**:
- 1 apply was BLOCKED by `context_consistency` (Maya's "Summarize Next Steps"). Not a bug — the validator correctly identified that the proposed addition contradicted existing prompt instructions. This is the safety net working.
- 1 measured outcome regressed (-27.6 pts). Realistic — not every fix improves things. The system surfaces it in the Measure narrative as "Regression: ... (re-investigate)" which is exactly what the customer should see.
- "Biggest leak: Recommendations Applied (17%)" correctly identifies user-actionable bottleneck — 38 recs queued, 8 applied.

**Reviewer-facing demo benefit**:
- Funnel feels production-scale (74 issues, not 8)
- Cross-agent patterns visibly cluster (not just one agent's bugs)
- Measure narrative is rich: "5/7 improved (71%) — 5 significantly. Best: 'Follow Script Steps' +20.3 pts. Regression: 'Confirm Appointment' -27.6 pts"
- All ~$0.50 in real OpenAI cost — reproducible on demand.

### Phase 5.0 — Actions ↔ Flywheel connection + delta-display fix

PM-grade observation from user: dashboard showed `actionsRequired: 67 (6600%)` and resolving 67 actions manually didn't move the flywheel. Two real product gaps:

**Fix 1: Period-over-period % capping** (`backend/src/routes/dashboard.js`)
- `pct()` now returns `null` when prior period < 5 (tiny base makes % meaningless — e.g. 1→67 reads as 6600% which is mathematically right but visually absurd)
- New `rawDelta(now, prev)` helper returns the absolute change
- Every hero metric now exposes both `delta` (%) and `deltaRaw` (count)
- `MetricHeroCard.vue` chooses: shows raw count when `delta` is null OR `|delta| > 500`; tooltip explains why

**Fix 2: Actions ↔ Flywheel disconnect** — Actions were purely operational (resolve/dismiss/escalate as a status overlay) with NO causal link to agent improvement. Resolving them was bookkeeping. New escalation-pattern auto-spawn closes the loop:

- `routes/actions.js POST /:callId/:turnIndex/:actionType/escalate` now calls `_maybeSpawnEscalationRec(callId, actionType)` after writing the status
- Counts escalations of the SAME `(agent_id, action_type)` in the last 30 days
- When count ≥ 3 AND no existing rec for that pattern → creates a new active recommendation:
  - `title`: `"Reduce recurring '{actionType}' escalations"`
  - `severity`: `warning`
  - `type`: `escalation_pattern`
  - `cluster_key`: `escalation pattern {actionType}` (stable, so subsequent escalations bump occurrence_count instead of creating duplicates)
  - `detail` + `suggested_change`: explain the pattern and direct user to investigate
- Auto-spawned rec flows naturally into Patterns view + Apply flow → flywheel closes
- Response now returns `spawnedRec` so the UI can surface a confirmation

**Fix 3: Honest labeling** (`frontend/src/views/ActionsView.vue`)
- Subtitle now reads: "**Operational triage queue** — moments the AI flagged for human follow-up. Resolving these doesn't change the agent itself; for agent improvement see [Patterns]. · Escalate 3+ times for the same action type and the system auto-creates a Patterns recommendation."
- Sets the right expectation upfront — resolve = ops bookkeeping, escalate = trigger improvement

**Verified end-to-end** on test DB (3 escalations of `script_training` on different reg-grace calls):
- 1st + 2nd escalation: `spawnedRec: null` (below threshold)
- 3rd escalation: `spawnedRec: { id, status: 'spawned', count: 3, title: 'Reduce recurring "script_training" escalations' }`
- New `recommendations` row with type=`escalation_pattern`, severity=warning, occurrence_count=3
- Visible immediately in `/patterns` page; can be applied via real V4 flow

### Phase 5.1 — Monitor→Improve Loop strip redesign

PM-grade observation from user: the Overview's `Core Functionality / Monitor → Analyze Loop` widget showed 4 generic steps (Ingest, Analyze, **Surface**, **Act**) that stopped before the closure. A reviewer looking at this card would see "this product detects problems" but miss "this product *closes the loop and proves the fixes work*" — i.e., the V4+ differentiator was invisible at the Overview level.

**Renamed**: `Monitor → Analyze Loop` → `Monitor → Improve Loop` (sets the right expectation: the product fixes things, doesn't just observe).

**5 steps replace 4**: Ingest → Analyze → Recommend → Apply → Measure. The last two are the V4-V4.8 work made visible — without them the card was a half-product narrative.

**Per-step trend deltas**: each card shows `↑ +N vs prior` colored by direction. Single point-in-time numbers don't tell a story; deltas do. Reviewer instantly sees motion.

**Closure callouts replace buried "Why" line** — two bold lines:
- `Closure: {closureRate}% of issues → significant improvement (Δ ≥ 2 pts, n ≥ 3)`
- `Best fix: "{title}" +{delta} pts (n={sampleSize})`

The "Best fix" line is the demo gold. On test DB: `"Follow the Script Steps" +20.3 pts (n=4)` — concrete proof the flywheel works.

**Pre-closure state** when nothing measured yet: replaces the callouts with a gentle "Apply a recommendation + accumulate post-apply calls to see the loop close." Honest framing, no fake numbers.

**Backend changes** (`/api/flywheel/summary` payload):
- New `monitorImproveStrip` field with `{ingest, analyze, recommend, apply, measure, bestFix}` shape
- Each stage has `current`, `prior` (same-length window shifted back), `deltaRaw`
- `analyze` includes `currentAvgScore` + `priorAvgScore` so the score delta is in points, not %
- `measure` exposes `significantCount` (Δ≥2 AND n≥3) and `anyCount` for the sub-label
- `bestFix` returns the highest-delta measured rec in the window (or null pre-closure)
- All computed in the existing `/api/flywheel/summary` route — no new endpoint

**Files**: `backend/src/routes/flywheel.js`, `frontend/src/components/MonitorAnalyzeHero.vue`

**Verified on test DB** (155 calls, 8 applied, 5 significant improvements): strip shows `Ingest 150 ↑146, Analyze 62/100 ↓3.9pts, Recommend 47 ↑47, Apply 8 ↑8, Measure 7 (5 significant) ↑7` + `Best fix: "Follow the Script Steps" +20.3 pts (n=4)`.
